# Malaria_detection

Solutions to detect one of the most widespread malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum)
using samples of thin blood smears on standard microscope slide.

A watershed segmentation technique is used to acquire the erythrocytes from microscopic blood sample images, 
followed by a deep learning classifier (convolutional neural network) . 
Transfer learning techniques were used to train the network.
